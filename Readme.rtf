PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A Bike Sharing company wants to estimate if the number of bikes taken on rent will rise as per different features like weather, pandemic recovery etc.\cb1 \

SUMMARY:
All the p-values are now < 0.05 and the VIF is < 5 for all the features. The R-square value is 0.788, which means that 78% of the deviation is explainable. 
While dropping the features, features with High p-value and high VIF were dropped first, later, High p-value, low VIF, subsequently Low p-value, High VIF.}
